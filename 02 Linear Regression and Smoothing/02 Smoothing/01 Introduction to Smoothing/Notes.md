# Introduction to Smoothing

### Motivation

The exercise introduces the concept of **smoothing**, a technique essential in data analysis and machine learning. Smoothing (also known as curve fitting or low-pass filtering) is used to detect trends in noisy data, where the underlying trend is not clearly known. In this context, we are concerned with finding the underlying trend in data while accounting for noise or deviations that could obscure it.

The goal of this exercise is to estimate the **time trend** of the 2008 US popular vote poll margin between Obama and McCain. The key insight here is that smoothing allows us to focus on the **shape of the trend** and estimate it in the presence of uncertainty, which is a useful technique for machine learning models that require conditional expectations or probabilities to be estimated.

This exercise demonstrates the limitations of a simple linear regression model when there are fluctuations or complex trends in the data, highlighting the need for more flexible methods like smoothing.

### Key Steps

1. **Load and visualize the Data**: Load the polls_2008 dataset, which contains polling data for the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Create a scatter plot of the margin (polling margin between candidates) against days (leading up to the election).
   
2. **Fit a Linear Regression**: Fit a simple linear regression model to the dataset and plot it to estimate the trend. Then, use the residuals from the linear regression to highlight discrepancies between the fitted line and the actual data points.

3. **Visualize the Result**: Create a plot is with both a regression line and points colored based on their residuals to help visualize how well the linear model fits the data.

### Key Takeaways

- **Smoothing vs Linear Regression**: Linear regression may not always capture the true underlying trend in noisy data, especially when there are complex fluctuations or non-linear trends.
- **Residues and Trend Estimation**: Analyzing residuals from a linear model can help identify where the model fails to capture important features of the data, leading to the need for a more flexible method.

### Libraries Used

- **`tidyverse`**: A collection of R packages (including `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`) for data manipulation and visualization.
- **`ggplot2`**: For creating plots, including scatter plots and smoothed lines (`geom_smooth()`).
- **`dslabs`**: Contains datasets such as `polls_2008` used for demonstrating the analysis.
