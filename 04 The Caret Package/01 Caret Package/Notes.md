# Caret Package

### Motivation

In the previous exercise, we explored the concept of cross-validation and used k-nearest neighbors (kNN) as an example to understand model evaluation and performance. Building on that, in this section, we will introduce the caret package, which significantly simplifies the process of training, tuning, and comparing machine learning models, including kNN.

The **`caret`** package (short for Classification And REgression Training) provides a consistent and unified interface for over 200 machine learning algorithms. It automates tasks like cross-validation, parameter tuning, and model comparison, making it easier to test different models and optimize their performance.

In this exercise, we will apply caret to the **`mnist_27`** dataset, which involves classifying digits as either 2 or 7. We will train both logistic regression and kNN models using caret, optimize their hyperparameters, and evaluate their performance with cross-validation. By leveraging the **`caret`** package, we can quickly evaluate different algorithms, compare their performance, and fine-tune model parameters â€” all while minimizing the need to manually handle the underlying complexity of model training and validation.

### Key Steps

1. **Load Libraries & Data**: Import `tidyverse`, `dslabs`, `caret` libraries, and load the `mnist_27` dataset.
2. **Train Models**: Train a logistic regression (`glm`) and k-nearest neighbors (`knn`) model using the `train()` function.
3. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained models to predict on the test set. Evaluate the accuracy using `confusionMatrix()`.
4. **Explore Models**: Explore model details using `getModelInfo()` and `modelLookup()` for kNN.
5. **Tune kNN**: Tune kNN hyperparameters and visualize results.
6. **Cross-Validation**: Perform 10-fold cross-validation to assess model performance. Visualize accuracy with `ggplot()`.
7. **Plot Probabilities**: Plot the predicted probabilities for the kNN model.

### Key Takeaways

- The **`caret`** package helps provides a uniform interface and standardized syntax for the many different machine learning packages in R. Note that **`caret`** does not automatically install the packages needed.
- The `train()` function automatically uses cross-validation to decide among a few default values of a tuning parameter.
- The `getModelInfo()` and `modelLookup()` functions can be used to learn more about a model and the parameters that can be optimized.
- We can use the `tunegrid()` parameter in the `train()` function to select a grid of values to be compared.
- The `trControl` parameter and `trainControl()` function can be used to change the way cross-validation is performed.
- Note that not all parameters in machine learning algorithms are tuned. We use the `train()` function to only optimize parameters that are tunable.

### Libraries Used

- **`caret`**: For training and tuning machine learning models.
- **`tidyverse`**: For data manipulation and visualization.
- **`dslabs`**: Dataset with the MNIST data
