# MNIST Case Study - Variable Importance

### Motivation

Unlike methods like linear regression, random forests can be difficult to explain or interpret. Variable importance highlights the contribution of predictors to a modelâ€™s performance, aiding in feature selection, simplifying models, and preventing overfitting. It enhances interpretability by revealing key drivers of predictions, provides insights into data patterns, and guides strategic decisions. Additionally, it helps debug models by identifying unexpected influential variables, ensuring alignment with domain knowledge and real-world applications.

### Key Steps

1. **Extract Feature Importance**: Retrieve feature importance scores from the Random Forest model and store them.
2. **Visualize Importance**: Display feature importance as a 28x28 grid matching MNIST dimensions.
3. **Predict Probabilities**: Predict class probabilities for the test data and normalize them to sum to 1.
4. **Analyze Misclassifications**: Identify and rank misclassified samples by their prediction confidence.
5. **Visualize Misclassified Samples**: Plot the top 4 misclassified samples, showing predicted and true classes along with prediction confidence.
